Every material object is first extrinsic in nature, then intrinsic to the subject’s point of view. This is due to the fact that material objects as we see them are built with certain mind principles and intended advantage for the purpose to which they serve.

That is to say: Material objects with respect to the user or consumer has two use cases, namely:

- #### Base Case
- #### Intrinsic  Case

## BASE CASE
The base case of a material object is the original, extrinsic and objective use for the object. Every material object crafted by man has a base case. The base case serves as the originality for other use cases of a material object. This essentially means that other use cases are branched off from the base case.
Hence, the <i>Theory Of Basic Utility Of A Material Object</i>
It states that for every material object crafted by mankind, with an intended purpose, there exists a base case or common ground use case to which the object is to be utilized.

To explain this further, we can take for instance, a Knife. A knife is an object whose base case is to cut through solid substances. We can draw that:

Base case (Cutting)

From this base case we can draw other use cases which apply intrinsically to the subject of use (conscious entity) at the moment it is being utilized.

Note: The conscious entity refers to any being that has the ability to manipulate the said object with a mind of its own.

Other intrinsic use cases may vary as:
- A butcher using a knife to cut a piece of meat.
- A cook using a knife as a kitchen utensil to cut food items.
- A serial killer using a knife for murder.

It can be detected that for any intrinsic utility, the base case which is to cut through substances remain the same, thereby proving the <u>theory of basic utility</u> to be true.

A very important question that may arise in the subject matter is:
Is the base case for a material object subject to change?

Within physical boundaries and the physical properties of the object, no, it does not change. But within the circumstantial and logical boundaries, yes, it can change.

Back to the example of a knife. A knife is made precisely for cutting through objects given that it has sharp edges. This properly doesn't change due to its extrinsic use case, but in a situation where a person uses a knife to scoop paste in the kitchen because they are too lazy to reach out for a spoon instead. The knife gets the job done and at that point may be more logical due to the circumstances because the fact still remains that it is an object with a sharp blade and a pointy edge.

## INTRINSIC CASE
The intrinsic case for an object is the subjective use for a material object. Irrespective of the base case, the intrinsic case differs with respect to entity and moment of use. The factors that affect the intrinsic case of a material object are:

- Conscious Entity
- Moment of use

The conscious entity refers to any user that utilizes the object for any purpose.

The moment of use refers to the circumstances, time and space in which an object is to be used.

The mind of mankind is in a constant, ever-evolving paradigm. The mind of mankind is also built to learn and adapt to new ways or methods of solving problems as well as modifying existing learning patterns and knowledge to suite different times and situations. It is due to this fact that intrinsic use cases can be derived from base cases.

Hence the Theory Of Variable Utility Of An Object:

It states that for every material object, the intrinsic case must be derived as sub-levels of its base case with intents which are subjective.
